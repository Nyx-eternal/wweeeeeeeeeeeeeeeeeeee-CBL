For the best experience I reccomend not playing in fullscreen.
!!AUDIO WARNING: the gameover screen is quite loud so wouldnt reccomend having your volume too high.

CONTROLS :
W, A, S, D - movement
SPACE_BAR - attack
R - reset in a win or gameover screen

To start, all you need to do is press any key. The goal is to defeat the boss. At the halfway point, the boss enters Phase 2 which means the attacks you dodge get faster quicker, and that there are more overall. The bar at the top of the screen is the bosses health, and the green bar at the bottom is your, the player's, health.
